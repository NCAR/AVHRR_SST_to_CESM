This is a cleaned up, pared down method for generating a new 'resolution'
using the 1/4 degree, Reynold's/AVHRR SSTs, circa 2015 and 2018.

I'll gather steps from generating the 1 degree CAM-FV resolution files,
and test while generating a 2 degree CAM-FV + 1/4 degree SST resolution file.
I tried to gather most of it into
   /glade/p/work/raeder/Models/CAM_init/SST

This may be done in a more recent version of CAM than cesm1_5_alpha02d,
which I used for the 1 degree.

2018:
See FIXED? which notes things that didn't work the first time around
but may be fixed in CESM2_0.
Also see 2018 for things I may need to do or know 
   in order to install d025 as a standard choice.

PIECES:
   Tomas: 
      I found some notes too that document the steps I took to set up a case.  
      I took a quick look and it appears that 3 things need to be done:
      1) Change  $SANDBOX/scripts/ccsm_utils/Case.template to add a new resolution option
      2) Change the coupler namelist to point to the new remapping files
      3) Change the ice and ocean namelists to specify the filenames for the (0.25 deg) data stream.
      The notes are here:

I seem to have made new grid+mapping files.
Hopefully this is available through the new resolution 0.9x1.25_0.25x0.25
    (2018: name changed to 0.9x1.25_d025_gland20 later?)

    x Add the -grid_file argument to create_newcase

    X It looks like I'll need to run the remainder of 2005, then update the SST file name to 2006
         and continue the run.
         NO; feed a list of filenames to CESM and it will find the right time.
             (despite the env_run.xml SST entry that says 'file', not 'file(s)')

INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------
To generate grid mapping files for the 1/4 degree AVHRR files.

http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.3/cesm/doc/usersguide/x2417.html
   (2018: cesm1.3 now contains the CESM2.0 documentation.
    cesm1.2 is similar/the same)
   EXPERTS: How do I add a new user-defined grid?
   * * This was written for CESM1.2, so some parts are outdated. * *
   I was able to start part way through these instructions because of the work
     Bob Tomas did.

Step #, from usersguide; my comments, updates for CESM1_5

2) Build this so that it's available to Step 3) gen_cesm_maps.sh
   I first did this in Models/cesm1_4_beta06/cime/tools/mapping/check_maps.
   The 1/4 degree ocean to 1 degree atm checked out.
     $ module load esmf
     $ module load esmf-{recent_version}-ncdfio-uni-O
     $ echo $ESMFMKFILE
     $ cd src
     $ gmake

3) $CIMEROOT/tools/mapping/gen_mapping_files/gen_cesm_maps.sh
  should generate mapping files.
   (2018; this may have been replaced by gen_atm_ocn_maps/gen_atm_ocn_maps.sh)
  It wants ESMF_RegridWeightGen from 2)
  In regridbatch.yellowstone.sh
     Provide an active account number, and optionally change the job name to include grid info.
     Update the directories:
        griddir1="/glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/mapping/grids"
        griddir2="/glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/mapping/grids"
        griddir3= {location of glc 'grids' SCRIP files}
                ="/glade/p/cesm/cseg/inputdata/glc/cism/griddata"
     Point to SCRIP grid files 
        griddir1="/glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/mapping/grids"
        fileocn="${griddir1}/0.25x0.25_100723.nc"
        fileatm="${griddir1}/fv0.9x1.25_141008.nc"
        filertm="${griddir2}/r05_coastal_080523.nc"
        fileglc="${griddir3}/{glc grid file}"
     Update 'name's
        nameocn='0.25x0.25'
        nameatm='fv0.9x1.25'
        namertm='r0.5x0.5'
     Submit regridbatch.yellowstone.sh in
         /glade/p/work/raeder/Models/cesm1_4_beta06/cime/tools/mapping/gen_mapping_files

FIXED?
   There's a whole new directory for runoff_to_ocean files.
      But it doesn't work.  The 'set's at the beginning need =.
    * This needs to be fixed after every time that configure is run
        set COMPILER intel
        set DEBUG FALSE
        set MPILIB mpi-serial
     I built runoff_map, but it failed because 
          /glade/p/cesm/cseg/mapping/grids/0.25x0.25_100723.nc doesn't have the grid_area variable in it,
       which is a single dimension (1036800 = ni x nj).
       But $p/Models/CAM_init/SST/domain.ocn.025.120821.nc  does have 'area' in the right units, but (nj,ni).
       NCO to the rescue: Need to reshape 'area' from domain.ocn.025.120821.nc 
          ncap2 may do it: var1 'assign_op' exp1
             if exp1 is a variable and it doesn't conform to var1 then an attempt is made 
             to make it conform to var1. 
          Copy 0.25 to temp.nc.
          Copy 'area' variable from domain.ocn to temp.nc 
             ncks -v area -o temp.nc domain.ocn.025.120821.nc
          Use ncap2 to create the required variable 'grid_area'
             ncap2 -s 'grid_area=array(1.,1,$grid_size);grid_area=area;' -o temp_grid_area.nc temp.nc
                      |          |     ||               |
                      |          |     ||               ^ Fill the array we just created.
                      |          |     ||                 ncap2 will try to make 2D area conform 
                      |          |     ||                 to 1d grid_area
                      |          |     ^^ This tells it to make grid_area a double precision
                      |          ^ This creates an array, starting with value 1., incrementing by 1, 
                      |            and size $grid_size
                      ^crucial to use this instead of "
             Use the permute() method to swap the dimensions of a variable.              
                 Apparently not necessary.  It loaded 1 latitude's worth of points (nj of them) 
                 at a time, which is the same as /glade/p/cesm/cseg/mapping/grids/gx3v7_120309.nc
          Remove variables 'area,xc,xv,yc,yv' and their dimensions.
              ncks -v grid_dims,grid_center_lat,grid_center_lon,grid_imask,grid_corner_lat,\
                   grid_corner_lon,grid_area \
                   -o 0.25x0.25_160301.nc temp_grid_area.nc
       Use /glade/p/work/raeder/Models/CAM_init/SST/0.25x0.25_160301.nc   in
          $CIMEROOT/tools/mapping/gen_mapping_files/runoff_to_ocn/runoff_map/runoff_map.nml
       But it's too slow to run interactively, so package it in a script: ..../runoff_to_ocn.csh
       Use the result in {path_where_config_grid.xml_lives}/config_grid_{details}.xml

FIXED?
   BUT I still don't have the mapping file from glc/cism/gland20 to the ocean,
      which prompted this whole tangent.
      NOTE; glad5UM for CISM1 (single threaded) is too large to fit 15 instances on a node.
            There appears to be no way to spread them out, so I settled for gland20  (20 km).
      See ./config_grids+fv1deg_oi0.25.xml, 
          /glade/p/work/raeder/Models/cesm1_5_beta03_clm_r162_pop_20151215_mosart1_0_14/\
              cime/tools/mapping/gen_mapping_files/regridbatch.yellowstone.sh
          $cesm_datapath/cpl/gridmaps/gland20km:   glc mapping files (SCRIP files used to make these)
          where are glc SCRIP files? 
             Note that there is a gland20km/map_gland20km_to_gx3v7_nnsm_e1000r300_150514.nc
             which looks like it was made by the same programs as the runoff_to_ocn program.
                :domain_a = "/glade/p/cesm/cseg/inputdata/glc/cism/griddata/SCRIPgrid_gland_5km_c150511.nc" ;
                :domain_b = "/glade/p/cesm/cseg/mapping/grids/gx3v7_120309.nc" ;
             So /glade/p/cesm/cseg/inputdata/glc/cism/griddata is the place
             _nnsm_ is owned by Bill Sacks; 
                says to use runoff_to_ocn, with a namelist tailored for glc/cism.
                I did this in a new directory; landice_to_ocn
          Try /glade/p/cesm/cseg/inputdata/glc/cism/griddata/SCRIPgrid_gland_20km_c150511.nc
      where are other SCRIP files?  /glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/mapping/grids
         gx3v7_120309.readme  has a lot of potentially useful (and/or outdated) instructions.



4) Generate atmosphere, land and ocean / ice domain files.
   Follow instructions in INSTALL, except:
     > set CIMEROOT = $cesm_tag/cime
     > Add '-cimeroot $CIMEROOT' to the configure command
   Follow instructions in README, providing  the 1/4 degree to 1 degree aave filename created in 3)
      $ gen_domain -m ../gen_mapping_files/map_0.25x0.25_TO_fv0.9x1.25_aave.{YYMMDD}.nc \
                   -o 0.25x0.25 \                                            
                   -l fv0.9x1.25 \
                   -c "domain file for a 1/4-degree ocean + 1-degree FV atmosphere for ATM_forc_XXX assimilations" \
                   -p 2      |& tee gen_domain_0.25_TO_0.9.out
      '-p 2' is the value requested by AMWG for (CLM) lon-lat grids.  See README for details.
             If this is omitted, there will be an error in CAM:
              ERROR: surfdata/fatmgrid lon/lat mismatch error  5.684341886080801E-014  0.235602094240804
              ENDRUN:ERROR in surfrdMod.F90 at line 427                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FIXED?
? ! But my current tag uses MOSART, not RTM.
    I'll try generating it anyway.

     
5) and 6) Don't apply to this case

7) The web page (cems1_2) says "The next step is to create a file - call it mygrid.xml"
   but that is outdated.  I had to manually modify a copy of 
      $CIMEROOT/cime_config/cesm/config_grids.xml
   to contain the directory and file names of the new grid mapping files.  E.g.
      ./config_grids+fv1deg_oi0.25.xml
   (which was generated and worked for the ATM_forcXX study tag cesm1_5_alpha02d.
    GWD_TMS_CLUBB has an example which includes an active CISM.)
   As far as I can tell, the glc (CISM) grid is tied to the CLM (and/or ATM) grids.
      So use those mapping files in config_grids.xml.

   a) <domains>
      If your new 'resolution' includes a new grid, 
      add it in the <domains> section of config_grids+yours.xml.
      <domain name="0.25x0.25">
        <nx>1440</nx> <ny>720</ny>
        <file lnd_mask="0.25x0.25">domain.lnd.fv0.9x1.25_0.25x0.25.150907.nc</file>
        <file ocn_mask="0.25x0.25">domain.ocn.0.25x0.25.150824.nc</file>
        <desc>0.25x0.25 is the AVHRR SST grid:</desc>
      </domain>
      Add lnd_mask lines as needed to accomodate other land grid interfaces.

   b) <grids>
      These <grid> entries make associations between a resolution long name,
      a short name, and maybe an even shorter alias.
      If the <grid> is expected to be widely used, then follow the loose convention of 
      setting sname to a combination of <domain> names.  If the the atm and lnd are on
      different grids, list them both.  Otherwise list that <domain> just once:
        <grid>                 atm <domain>     lnd <domain>    ocn <domain>
        --------------------   ------------     --------------  ----------------
        0.9x1.25_gx1v6         0.9x1.25 and     0.9x1.25        gx1v6
        ne30np4_1.9x2.5_gx1v6  ne30np4          1.9x2.5         gx1v6

      If the resolution is very special purpose, you can make up an sname which is not made
      of lots of grid <domain>s, but it just a descriptive name: e.g. Julio_FV1xSST.25

      The m% piece of lname refers to the mask between the atm and ocn grids.
      Set it to the ocn <domain>.

      A given short name can apply to > 1 long name.  This ambiguity is resolved by
      the 'compset' attribute, which comes from $COMPSET, and helps make the association with
      the desired lname.  After defining sname, you can include the compset attribute 
      to distinguish between variants (active, data, stub) of runoff, glacier and wave grids.  
      (2018; this may be a step in integrating d025 as a standard option; 
             interfaces with all of these data and stub component grids)
      Each combination of these 3 components requires its own <grid> entry:
      <grid compset="(DOCN|AQUAP).+MOSART.+CISM1.+SWAV">      glacier    stub wave model
        <sname>1.9x2.5_1.9x2.5</sname>          runoff res    resol      |
        <alias>f19_f19</alias>                  v             v          v
        <lname>a%1.9x2.5_l%1.9x2.5_oi%1.9x2.5_r%r05_m%gx1v6_g%gland5UM_w%null</lname>
      </grid>
      See config_grid.xml for more examples.

   c) <gridmap>
      Each pair of components which needs to communicate between different grids requires
      these mapping files.  The names have the form 
         map_<domain1>_TO_<domain2>_{maptype}.{date}.nc 
         map_type = 
             'aave' "conservative (area avg?)"         assigned to the FMAPNAME (Flux) attribute
             'blin' "bilinear (non-conservative)"      assigned to the SMAPNAME (State) attribute
             'patc' "patch mapping (non-conservative)" assigned to the VMAPNAME (Vector?) attribute
             '[nnsm_]e###r###  "Take a scrip conservative map matrix, runoff->ocean (unmasked ocean)
                               and produce a runoff->ocean map suitable for use in CCSM
                                                       assigned to the RMAPNAME of river runoff
                                                             sometimes FMAPNAME of river runoff.
                               Similar for glacier->ocean
         But file types assigned to VMAPNAME include _patch, _bilin_da, _patc, _aave_da, _aave, 
         _native, ...,  so that seems to be a name part which the user can set.
         VMAPNAME may refer to vector mapping (winds/currents?), which is supported by the
         fact that it only appears in ATM2OCN and OCN2ATM entries.
 
      (2018; Are there more mappings to worry about for d025 in CESM2_0?)
      Some pairs have one-way communication, so <1>_TO_<2> is needed, but not <2>_TO_<1>
      As of CESM1_5_beta03 the potential pairs and mappings are
          ATM <--> LND (may be identical -> no mapping file needed)
          ATM <--> OCN (CICE uses this mapping)
          LND <--> GLC
          LND <--> ROF
          ROF  --> OCN
          GLC  --> OCN
         (WAV <--> OCN   The mapping files to/from the wave model are not created by
         (ICE  --> WAV   the cesm1_5_beta03 mapping programs.

      Add <gridmap> section(s) to interface the new grid with existing grids of other components.
      This is 
      (for clarity define grid_path==/glade/p/work/raeder/Exp/GWD_TMS_CLUBB/mapping/gridmaps)
      <gridmap atm_grid="0.9x1.25" ocn_grid="0.25x0.25">
        <ATM2OCN_FMAPNAME>$grid_path/map_fv0.9x1.25_TO_0.25x0.25_aave.160303.nc </ATM2OCN_FMAPNAME>

      </gridmap>

        <ROF2OCN_FMAPNAME>$grid_path/map_r05_to_0.25_nnsm_e1000r300_160229.nc</ROF2OCN_FMAPNAME>
      </gridmap>
      <gridmap ocn_grid="0.25x0.25" glc_grid="gland20" >
        <GLC2OCN_RMAPNAME>$grid_path/map_gland20km_to_0.25_nnsm_e1000r300_160307.nc</GLC2OCN_RMAPNAME>
      </gridmap>

   d) Check that pre-existing grids, which are used in your resolution, 
      have the required <gridmap> entries.


8) Pass the location of the config_grids.xml file to create_newcase via
  -user_grid_file {path}/config_grids+fv1deg_oi0.25.xml

9) Also provide the locations of the domain files (4)) to the env_run.xml
  via xml_changes in the DART setup script.
  Be careful about 'aave' vs. 'blin' vs. 'patc'; the land and ocean fractions
     (and ...?) can be different, leading to inconsistencies.
