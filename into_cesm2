Here are steps I will (>>), or may (>), need to do 
to update the cesm2_0_beta05 hi-res SSTs into CESM2_0.

   http://esmci.github.io/cime/users_guide/grids.html:
      CIME looks at the xml node GRIDS_SPEC_FILE in 
      $CIMEROOT/config/cesm/config_files.xml
      to identify supported out-of-the-box model grids for the target model.
      That's filled with 
      $CIMEROOT/config/cesm/config_grids.xml

    (despite the env_run.xml SST entry that says 'file', not 'file(s)')

I've downloaded a couple SST files into
     /glade/p/work/raeder/Models/CAM_init/SST/avhrr-only-v2.YYYY0101_cat_YYYY1231_filled_c130829.nc
     where YYYY = 2010,2011

     hpss: /home/tomas/ds277.7/avhrr/avhrr-only-v2.YYYY0101_cat_YYYY1231_filled_c130829.nc
     > > > These files MUST have the 'calendar' attribute added to variable 'time',
           in order to run CAM using NOLEAP (and maybe GREGORIAN).
           Script add_calendar_attr.csh will do this.

When I believe that I have all the parts,
Start the pull request process:
   fork latest CIME to my cime github
   clone that to cheyenne
   branch that to an SST development version
   implement my changes
   test using CESM program
   issue PR
   

? Has gen_cesm_maps.sh been updated from yellowstone?

Yes.
