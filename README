See 2022-11-1, below, for most recent way to make SST files.

And 2018-11-15 for some history.
See before that line for older history.
----------------------------

The 1/4 degree Reynolds SSTs are available in
/home/tomas/ds277.7/avhrr/avhrr-only-v2.20050101_cat_20051231_filled_c130829.nc
This data set runs through 2013-7 so far, but the raw data are available from
monthly updates.

It looks like it's ready to be used by CAM, 
except that the files I've used are monthly (CAM interpolates to daily)
while these are daily.
>  What do I need to change in CAM to use these?

I may be able to make more recent dates using 
/glade/u/home/tomas/frank/high_res_data/forcing_summer_13/make_sst_ice_forcing.ncl
(see local copy) which was used to make
avhrr-only-v2.20050101_cat_20051231_filled_c130829.nc
And a script which fills in the land areas using a Poisson scheme.  
This solves problems created when there are grid boxes where CAM 
expects to find an SST value but there isn't one in the Reynold's SST (there is land).
./fill_sst_forcing.ncl
See 2018-11-15, below, for my attempt to do this.

I need a domain.ocn file.  The make_sst_ice_forcing.ncl lists
/glade/home/tomas/cesm/cesm1_1_beta15/mapping/gen_atm_ocn_maps/domain.ocn.0.25.120821.nc
but I can't find that file in the more modern location:
/glade/u/home/tomas/...anywhere
Nor on the HPSS.
Ha! I did find an archive of Bob Tomas' home directory:
/home/tomas/home_bf_31jan13.tar
which I could download.  The file seems to be in there!

Is this in a form CAM can use?

Follow instructions in README
Those files don't work in check_maps.
Because they're grid files?  SCRIP files?  both?
Ah, maybe I was supposed to just build it, not run it yet.

Move on to Step 3 of instructions:
> $CCSMROOT/tools/mapping/gen_mapping_files/gen_cesm_maps.sh
  should generate mapping files.
  But it needs the SCRIP files I was supposed to find in 1.
  The example scripts:
      regridbatch.yellowstone.sh   
         griddir1="/glade/scratch/mlevy/grids"
         fileocn="${griddir1}/tx0.1v2_090127.nc"
         cmdargs="--fileocn $fileocn ...
         env REGRID_PROC=$REGRID_PROC ./gen_cesm_maps.sh $cmdargs
      
      But /glade/scratch/mlevy/grids/tx0.1v2_090127.nc    doesn't exist anymore.
      But but look in /glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/mapping/makemaps/0.25x0.25_fv0.47x0.63_100723
         scrip_makemaps.csh refers to the outdated
            /fis/cgd/cseg/csm/mapping/grids
         The modern location is (?)
            /glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/mapping/grids
         In there I see  (the same files I tried in check_maps, above)
            0.25x0.25_100723.nc
            fv0.9x1.25_141008.nc
         This uses ESMF offline weight generation utility, which I need to build(?).
         No
         $ module load esmf
         $ module load esmf-6.3.0r-ncdfio-uni-O
         $ which ESMF_RegridWeightGen
           /glade/apps/opt/esmf/6.3.0r-ncdfio/intel/12.1.5/bin/binO/Linux.intel.64.mpiuni.default/ESMF_RegridWeightGen
     
      So, modify regridbatch.yellowstone.sh to use the grid files:
        griddir1="/glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/mapping/grids"
        fileocn="${griddir1}/0.25x0.25_100723.nc"
        fileatm="${griddir1}/fv0.9x1.25_141008.nc"
      I submitted regrid... in 
         /glade/p/work/raeder/Models/cesm1_4_beta06/cime/tools/mapping/gen_mapping_files

4. Generate atmosphere, land and ocean / ice domain files.
   The instructions in 
      /glade/p/work/raeder/Models/cesm1_4_beta06/cime/tools/mapping/gen_domain_files/INSTALL
   needed to have -cimeroot $CIMEROOT appended to the configure command
   After building gen_domain, I ran
   $ gen_domain -m ../gen_mapping_files/map_0.25x0.25_TO_fv0.9x1.25_aave.150824.nc \

     write domain.lnd.fv0.9x1.25_0.25x0.25.150824.nc
     successfully created domain file domain.lnd.fv0.9x1.25_0.25x0.25.150824.nc
     write domain.ocn.fv0.9x1.25_0.25x0.25.150824.nc
     successfully created domain file domain.ocn.fv0.9x1.25_0.25x0.25.150824.nc

7.  Manually created 
    /glade/p/work/raeder/Models/cesm1_4_beta06/cime/tools/mapping/gen_domain_files/ATM_forc_XXX.xml
    I removed all the GLOB lines because each of these component grids already exists in CESM.

8.  Need to append mapping file path names to the end of user_nl_cpl during the setup:
       setenv MAPPING_FILE_LOC = /glade/p/work/raeder/Models/cesm1_4_beta06/cime/tools/mapping/gen_mapping_files
       atm2ocnFmapname='$MAPPING_FILE_LOC/map_fv0.9x1.25_TO_0.25x0.25_aave.150824.nc'

I replaced all of the avhrr-only-v2.201[1-7]_filled_c*.nc
with files that don't have the days from the bracketing years.
So now each file has just the days from the year in the file name.
Temporarily, the files with the bracketing days are in 
$fname:r_temp.nc

===================================================
2021-10-26  KDR
New, unfortunate developments:
We discovered in inconsistency between the definition of the time
"valid at mid day" and the values (whole numbers of days since 1978-01-01 *00Z*).  
Partly as a result of this(?) the avhrr data set on the RDA was replaced 
with different SSTs sometime in 2020.  
They weren't just relabeled with consistent times.
They were supposedly remaking the same data set, but the new fields
did not even look like midpoints between the old fields.
I could not get an explanation from CISL or the original creators (email).
(See also email with Gaubert, who wanted part of 2020 in late 2020.)
[See 2021-11-5 below for context Ben dug up]

The file I created to cover through 2020-05 has fractional days for the 
span in 2020, but whole numbers before that.
avhrr-only-v2.2011-202005_0Z_filled_c200807.nc
"Center time of the day" ;
 time:units = "days since 1978-01-01 00:00:00
So the earlier times are (still) not consistent with that description,
while the later times are.  Also see the skip from 15339 to 15340.5.

For a while the old files were available on glade.
They were not used to make
avhrr_v2.1-only-v2.20200101-20200607_filled_c200622.nc
which has whole day times from 1978-01-01 *12:00:00*.
So that's internally consistent.

So what do we have?
avhrr-only-v2.2011-202001_0Z_filled_c200810  extends through 2020-1-30.
   It has whole number days throughout.
   The time for 1978-1-1 is 0 because a script that counted that day as 1 and yielded
   > ./date_from_daynum.csh 15340  -> 2019-12-31  
   while /gpfs/fs1/collections/rda/decsdata/ds277.7/V/avhrr/avhrr-only-v2.20200101.time
   has that day number.
   I've updated the script to count as the files do, from 0.
   That series of files only goes through 2020-4-13.
   This is described (in the nc files) as
      "Reynolds, et al.(2007) Daily High-resolution Blended Analyses.
       Available at ftp://eclipse.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/OI-daily/daily-sst.pdf
       Climatology is based on 1971-2000 OI.v2 SST, Satellite data: Navy NOAA18 METOP AVHRR, Ice data: NCEP ice"

avhrr_v2.1-only-v2.20200101-20200607_filled_c200622.time extends through 2020-6-7
   It has whole number days counted from 12:00 on 1978-01-01

RDA says ds277.7 has data 1981-09-01 12:00 +0000 to 2021-10-10 12:00 +0000 
   AVHRR iVersion 2.1 infrared satellite SST data
   And now I see it from Jun 19  2020 :
        /gpfs/fs1/collections/rda/data    /ds277.7  /avhrr_v2.1/2020/oisst-avhrr-v02r01.20200101.nc
   old: /gpfs/fs1/collections/rda/decsdata/ds277.7/V/avhrr     /2020     /avhrr-only-v2.20200101.time
   This is described as 
      "uses Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared satellite SST data. 
       It also uses in situ data from ships and buoys and include a large-scale adjustment 
       of satellite biases with respect to the in situ data."

- - - - -
So, I think the least ugly solution is to make a new file for the 2020-present assimilation.
It will have times counted as whole days from 1978-01-01 12Z, which is day 0.
It will use files 
   /gpfs/fs1/collections/rda/data/ds277.7/avhrr_v2.1/2020/oisst-avhrr-v02r01.YYYYMMDD.nc
It will also have data that seems inconsistent with the data in the 00Z files,
but that discontinuity in the Reanalyses will be at the transition from 2019 to 2020.
which is easier to describe or remember than part way through 2020,
and won't require switching SST files then.
It will need to have at least 1 time slot from 2019, so that CAM can interpolate
between 2019-12-31 12Z and 2020-01-01 12Z when advancing from 2020-01-01 00Z to 12Z.
It should be possible to use the 00Z file from 2019-12-31 and relabel its time to 12Z,
but that would be misrepresenting what it is.  Maybe it doesn't matter either way.

--------------------
2021-11-2

It is difficult to know how to proceed here. I'll try to summarize:
1. The products are obviously qualitatively different.
2. We do not have enough information to assess whether one or the other is better.
3. The differences are large enough that they would have significant impact 
   on the lowest level forecasts in certain places.
4. It is difficult to assess how large the resulting differences 
   will be in a reanalysis.
5. Many of our users want the surface forcing files which 
   are the most likely thing to be impacted.
6. It seems unlikely that we will be able to have any impact, 
   especially in the short-term, on how these are produced.

Questions:
1. I understand that the 'old' product is no longer available 
   after some date in the middle of 2020. 
   Is it accurate to say that there is no way 
   we could produce the old product ourselves?
2. There is obviously an overlap period with both new and old product. 
   How long is that overlap period?
3. How often is the new product updated? 
   What is the most recent date for which it is currently available?

Thanks, Jeff

Q1; It's probably true that we can't produce the old product.
They couldn't explain the differences, even though they presumably
have the code(s) that produced both.  I could ask them for the codes,
but I would expect getting them and setting them up would take
significant time, if they would even send them.  
Then there's a non-negligible chance that the output wouldn't match 
either their old or new products.  
The derivation of the products is described in at least on paper,
but developing new code based on that seems like a tangent
we don't want to go off on.

Q2; The old dataset covers 1981-09-01...2020-04-13
    The new dataset covers 1981-09-01...2021-10-17
Q3: So there seems to be a 2 week lag in generating the new files.

The differences between v2.1 and v2.0 are:

1.  Satellite NOAA-19 is replaced by MetOp-B; MetOp-A remains unchanged 
    (MetOp-A and MetOp-B are European, polar-orbiting meteorological satellites);
2.  The SST proxy using the regression between ice concentration and SST is replaced by 
    using the freezing-point temperature in ice-covered oceans (Banzon et al. 2020);
3.  The estimated ship SST bias is reduced from 0.14°C to 0.01°C. 
    The biases of 0.14ºC and 0.01ºC are based on observations in riods 
    1982-2000 and 2016-2019, respectively;
4.  Ship and buoy observations from Daily ICOADS (ICOADS-D) Release 3.0.2 (R3.0.2; Liu et al. 2020) 
    are used instead of NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) 
    Global Telecommunications System (GTS) receipts;
5.  Argo float observations (Argo 2000; Roemmich et al. 2001) above 5 m depth are included 
    to ensure the best quality of SST production using all available in situ observations.

Instructions for Will Chapman (and me).

1) Check the range of files available in 
   /gpfs/fs1/collections/rda/data/ds277.7/avhrr_2.1/YYYY
2) Edit avhrr_sst_to_cesm_v2022.csh to set the 
   modules (the set loaded in batch jobs may not be the same as in the interative environment)
   date ranges (partial years require changes to the cp commands), 
   file paths and names, 
3) > qsub avhrr_sst_to_cesm_v2022.csh  (I've done it on casper, since it's a data processing job)

4) Check the times of the yearly .nc files with 
   > ncdump -v time $yearly.nc > $yearly.time
   If they're sequential across the file limits, including the pre-existing file
   onto which the new ones will be appended, proceed.

5) Edit fill_version_forcing.ncl to set the output file names,
   especially if doing partial years.
6) Run fill... using
   > qsub fill_sst_forcing.csh

7) > ncrcat pre-existing.nc earliest_new.nc ... latest_new.nc $output.nc
